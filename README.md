Backend code written for an eCommerce website. I learned quite a bit about routes and associations.

## Installation

Nothing to install.

## Usage

Run the schema file in SQL shell, run the server.js file to populate the DB with tables, run the seeds files to populate the data, and test the routes using Insomnia.
